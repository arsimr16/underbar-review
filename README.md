# underbar-review
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
I reimplemented the following functions from [underscore.js](https://underscorejs.org) without using built-in JS function (forEach, map, filter, etc.):
* identity
* first
* last
* each
* indexOf
* filter
* reject
* uniq
* map
* pluck
* reduce
* contains
* every
* some
* extend
* defaults
* once
* memoize
* delay
* shuffle
* invoke
* sortBy
* zip
* flatten
* intersection
* difference
* throttle

I also fixed broken tests to become more familiar with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
